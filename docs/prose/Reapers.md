#Reapers

Sitting in the cradle always gave Marcus goose bumps. As articulated machines assembled ceramic armour overtop of his woven carbon fibre under layer, his mind was elsewhere. The room was bare grey metal with steel arms fixed on all surfaces, pulling parts from marked and coded bins that sprung from slots in the walls. In the center rested the series of concentric rings affectionately dubbed the cradle. Spending one’s five minutes getting spun around in that human-sized gyroscope meant death was coming ever nearer. The cradle meant you were getting ready for a real battle. And this time Marcus was in command of his own gunship. 

Taking a deep breath as a robotic arm pressed his chest plate down, Marcus counted the bolts as they were tightened. Four. Four bolts holding together everything that would protect him from bullets, explosions, and impact. A soft female voice politely asked for him to exit using the steps rising beneath his feet. 
 
“Thanks Mia,” Marcus said as he followed instruction. He wasn’t sure if the computer program could really hear him, but he liked to be polite all the same. The mechanically integrated armourer, or MIA for short, operated nearly one hundred cradles at the same time, fitting custom armour to each and every fighter pilot in the Protectorate’s air force. Marcus figured she did not have time to pay attention even if she could hear him.
 
Lights along the floor illuminated the path to the flight deck, a walk Marcus was quite familiar with. He stepped into line with all of the other soldiers, each one liveried for their respective roles. Marcus inspected the orange band that had been added to the arm of his flight suit. Commander. That bright bar of colour made him stand out, for obvious reasons. He was a symbol of authority, of leadership, of hope. It also made him a target. The walls around him began to feel much closer, the air heavier. The faces of the men and women around him appeared to blur and cease to be. 

Marcus arrived at the flight deck on autopilot, shaking himself from his stupor as the sliding doors permitted him to hangar seven. He couldn’t help but smile as he laid eyes on her, waiting strapped into a launch harness. The flexible polyester straps hugged her dark curves, wrapping just under the port and starboard wing connections. Webbing spanned out under the gently sloped fuselage, cradling her like she was made of crystal. She looked like a bat with its wings outstretched in flight, suspended there in the centre of the hangar. The EAF-43 Peregrine Falcon, a technical marvel of aerodynamics and stealth, and she was his to pilot. Taking long slow steps as he walked over to the equipment locker to retrieve his helmet, Marcus took his time admiring every feature down to the titanium body paneling. He itched to climb into the cockpit and get his fingers on the controls. The sweat from his palms dried as he began to vibrate with something he would never admit to be giddiness.

The rest of the crew was already at the other end of the bay, looking out of the view ports set into the airlock. A quick thirty meter jog and Marcus was with them. The three others were watching a burning city centre below them, their helmets couched under their arms. Rockets flared in the sky as the frigate continued its bombardment upon the frigid landscape. The city was nestled in the shadow of a mountain range resembling the spine of some great serpent. 

“People need to realize when they’ve been beat,” Derek said with a smirk. The lights flashed in his dark brown eyes. 

“What would you do?” Elaina retorted as she blew a loose strand of red hair from her face. “In their place?” 

“Highjack a mobile drone command centre and outfit the fleet with stolen guns and missiles. What would you do?”

“Funny. I don’t condone their methods, but they didn’t get much of a choice. The Protectorate will never forgive them.” 

“No, they won’t,” Marcus interrupted. “And that’s why we’re going to blow that fleet, along with its stolen guns and missiles, up.”

“Are we ready then, commander?” Keith said with a salute, turning to face Marcus. His blonde hair was cropped close to his scalp with long scars visible between the prickly fibres. 

Marcus nodded, squinting as a building far below erupted in a fireball, belching black smoke into the air. It appeared command had been serious about eliminating every inch of the insurrection. 

“Get to your stations. Green light in ten,” Marcus said, taking one last look at the snowy wasteland below them before breaking off at jog for the Falcon. Elaina followed close behind, heading towards the stepladder standing by the forward cockpit, the lightly tinted glass canopy open and waiting. The others diverted towards a ladder standing by the aft entry port, a small hole about one metre across that would lead them to their respective weapons controls. Derek was chief gunner, in charge of the gunship’s main battery and payload while Keith was on the rear anti-aircraft turret. 

Marcus’s heart was thumping as he slipped into the pilot’s seat and strapped himself in, the firm leather embracing him like an old friend. Elaina clambered in behind him, booting up the flight systems and navigation computer. Pulling his helmet on as he flicked the “canopy shut” switch, Marcus’s vision disappeared while the heads up display blinked to life. His eyes were bombarded with information; flight data, biometrics of his crew mates, mission status and command messages. Operation Poison Arrow was go. 

As the canopy clicked shut, Marcus watched the step ladders fold into the flooring below. The world grew small in a matter of seconds. All around him were buttons, dials and touch screens flooded with information. A few short eye movements and he knew flight systems were okay and the craft was ready to prep launch. 

“How’s the air back there?” Marcus said, his voice echoing slightly over the radio.

“A little stale but the guns and bombs are okay, boss,” Derek replied. 

“Waiting for targets,” Keith added. 

“Elaina, initiate launch prep.”

Elaina echoed his instructions as her fingers began tapping away at her control panel. For a moment, Marcus felt his stomach lurch as the floor beneath the aircraft fell away and the harness flexed under the weight. He laughed to himself, unable to hold back a grin. Every time. 

They were carried down into the bowels of the frigate as darkness enveloped them. Mechanical clanks and booms were the only sounds as machines took hold of the falcon, mounting it in the proper position for launch. They were sitting in one of several aircraft launch tubes, waiting for the green light.

“Lighting engines,” Marcus stated, pressing a sequence of panels and buttons that were more reflex than memory. He felt a slight jolt as the turbojets spun up, straining the brakes holding them in place.

“Strain at five percent and holding,” Elaina reported. 

“Awaiting launch initiation,” Marcus said. His eyes were staring off into the apparent nothingness of the launch tube, gaze fixed on where he knew a green light would be appearing any moment. Three . . . two . . . one. The green light flickered on and Marcus opened the throttle to full. The aircraft railed against its restraints like a chained wolf, clamouring to be free.

“Strain at twenty five percent and holding.”

The launch timer Marcus was waiting for chimed as it appeared on his control panel. Ten seconds to launch. A shiver trickled down his spine as he flexed his fingers over the brake release. With six seconds remaining on the timer, a bright point of light appeared down the tunnel as the bay doors slid open.

“Steel yourselves boys and girl,” Marcus said as the timer neared two. 

“Punch it boss!” Derek hooted as the clock ticked zero.

“Releasing restraints,” Marcus said, pressing the red button under his thumb. There was a click as the brakes let go, and a roar as the aircraft accelerated from rest. The exit grew larger as they rocketed towards it, the light of day blinding as they crossed the threshold. Looking around him, Marcus checked for the fighter squadron that would be serving as their escort. Twenty four EAF-12 Hummingbird light attack aircraft. They would deal with the majority of the opposing forces while the Falcon hit the target with two high-impact precision missiles. One of the last steps in cleaning up the mess the Insurrection had created.

Behind them, the frigate disappeared as they hurtled over the mountain range, reaching their velocity vector of four times the speed of sound. The hummingbird squadron took up formation around the falcon, the single-seaters dwarfed by the gunship’s bulk.

“This is Hatchet-one reporting in. How’s the package Reaper?” the squad leader said, his voice coming through the radio sounding as if it had been filtered through a pillow.

“Ready for delivery. Glad to have you flyboys watching our back,” Marcus replied. “Expect heavy resistance upon arrival. Command has requested radio silence until engagement.”

“Copy that Reaper. Switching to local channels.” 
Marcus flicked the radio switch, cutting all contact with the outside world. It was just him and his crew now, strapped into their cage tearing across the clear blue sky. They had simulated the mission with Hatchet Squadron more times than he could count. The odds of survival were high but computer sims were only so accurate. Real life was random and computers had a hard time factoring in human error.  In a few minutes they would have eyes on target and then the real test would begin. He could hear Elaina’s breathing over the radio. Apparently she was having similar thoughts. 

“Everyone peachy?” Marcus asked as he checked their position vector. Two minutes to target. The four of them could see that displayed on the respective tactical panel. 

“Green, mean and ready boss!” Derek cheered. Marcus imagined him bouncing off the walls of his cabin, though he knew the payload bay had the least space of all compartments. Perhaps he was simply vibrating under his seatbelt. 

“Good to go commander, though Hatchet-four seems to think its funny to sit in my direct firing line,” Keith sighed, likely trying his best to ignore the rear escort. 

“Our vectors are good and she’s still holding together. Clear skies means easy targeting. For us, and them. Keep that throttle open, sir,” Elaina said. 

Marcus twisted in his seat to look back at her. He held up a fist and she bumped it with a gloved hand. “Noted, lieutenant. Stay frosty, eyes-on in thirty seconds.”

Counting to ten before killing the afterburners, Marcus bled speed until they came down below Mach one, coasting over miles of frozen forests and snow-capped mountains. A stone appeared in the pit of Marcus’s stomach as he spotted the enemy command centre docked in a wide valley just at the edge of his vision. Despite the distance, he knew that was it. Resembling an ancient aircraft carrier, back when they still launched airplanes from ships, it had four rotors as large as family homes and a flight deck like four football fields arranged in a square. 
Marcus bit back a curse, letting it dissolve into a growl from the back of his throat as he watched what looked like a thin black cloud rising from the deck of the command centre. The insurrectionists were far better equipped than their intelligence had suggested.

“Looks like we’ve got company,” Marcus said as his tactical map flooded with little red dots. Surveyor drones refitted with heat seeking missiles. Leave humans alone long enough and they will turn anything into a weapon, Marcus thought to himself. A soft chime rang in his ears as the flight computer alerted him to enemy signal lock. 

“Jamming their communications. Should be able to knock a few of them out of the sky,” Elaina said as her hands got to work, her fingers a blur as she worked the controls. “They weren’t supposed to have picked us up yet!”

“Who cares? More targets for us to smoke. Line ‘em up so I can knock ‘em down!” Derek said as the weapons systems light turned on. 

“Stay focused,” Marcus snapped. “You have clearance to fire on targets in direct line of sight. Otherwise, maintain efforts on acquiring target lock.”

“Got it boss!”

“Elaina, I’m switching to manual control, can you monitor flight systems?”

“Yes commander.”

“Here we go,” Marcus muttered as he took full control from the flight computer. With a tilt of the joystick the falcon dropped from formation and accelerated back up to supersonic, the hummingbirds fanning out as the drones entered firing range. Missiles snaked out, claiming targets in bursts of black smoke. It looked as if they were flying into a swarm of angry hornets, if the hornets had rocket launchers strapped to their undersides. They were sorely outnumbered. Marcus grimaced as friendly markers began disappearing from his tactical map. He was glad for the radio silence. 

“Sir, we could neutralize several of them if –” Elaina began.

“No. Let them do their job, so we can do ours,” Marcus said through gritted teeth. If they could slow down to help, he would. They would be a sitting duck.

“Sir. Yes, sir.”

“Keith, weapons free. Low profile rounds. Make them count,”

“Aye commander,” Keith replied as the thrum of the rear turret vibrated through the cabin. Marcus felt Elaina grip his shoulder as a private message appeared on his communications panel. Thank you.

“Boss, I’ve got an ETA on that target acquisition you ordered,” Derek said. “One minute approximately. She’s exposed, easy lock. Javelin missiles won’t have a problem.”

“Good work. Prepare for payload deployment. Elaina –” Marcus was cut off as he was tossed in his seat, his shoulder impacting the control panel to his left. His armour absorbed most of the impact but he knew he’d be feeling that one the next morning. The flight computer was showing minor hull damage over the gunner’s cabin. No doubt they’d been aiming for the main engines. Marcus shook his head as he tried to regulate his breathing. That was too close.

“Interceptor, starboard side! Derek, can you acquire lock?” Elaina shouted. 

“Where did they a get stealth interceptor?” Keith asked, his fire uninterrupted.

“Derek?” Marcus repeated, the emptiness in his stomach growing deeper. His biometrics had disappeared from his feed. Not a flat line, just gone. System failure. After a few moments of silence, Marcus wanted to throw up. 

“Elaina, you have flight controls. I’m going to make sure we still have target lock. Keith, see if you can’t catch him with the fragmentation rounds,” Marcus said as he unclipped his restraints and crawled around the seat into the service corridor behind. The two shouted affirmation, strain clear in their voices. 

“I can’t hit him at this speed commander,” Keith said as Marcus squeezed down the narrow passage with a white knuckled grip on the handles along the wall. His arms screamed as Elaina manoeuvred to avoid incoming fire. Keying entry to the gunner’s compartment, Marcus braced for the worst. The doors slid open to reveal Derek slumped in his seat in front of the controls, blood trickling out the bottom of his helmet. There was a long crack in the visor, likely caused when they were tossed around. It still didn’t explain the biometrics but Marcus didn’t have time to waste. 

There was no time to remove Derek from his seat and strap in, so Marcus unclipped the restraints and sat in Derek’s lap, pressing himself back against his body as much as he could. Letting out the seatbelt as far as it would go, he secured the clasp, hoping it would be enough to prevent another head injury as the aircraft rolled. On cue, the aircraft lurched and Derek’s helmet slammed against the back of his own. Ignoring what felt like a bad omen, Marcus got to work checking on the target lock. The targeting computer was flashing, an alarm ringing loudly in the gunner’s cabin. The display read out TARGET LOCKED: STABILIZE FOR PAYLOAD DEPLOYMENT. 

“Elaina, I need you to lock our vector for five seconds,” Marcus said as he initiated payload deployment. 

“I don’t think that’s a good idea commander,” Elaina said as she pulled the falcon through a barrel roll. Marcus’s vision blurred under the force of the manoeuvre. 

“You need to do it now or we’ll miss our launch window.”

“Sir . . .”

“Now!”

The g-forces subsided as Marcus felt the aircraft level out as the targeting computer flashed a green light. TARGET LOCKED: PAYLOAD DEPLOYMENT READY. Marcus punched the launch button, slamming it down hard enough to make the displays blink. Two “Javelin” high-impact precision missiles were jettisoned from the payload bay, laser-guided towards their target. 

Marcus let out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding as he let his muscles relax, slumping back in the chair. Elaina resumed evasive manoeuvres as a hail of cannon fire peppered the hull. Marcus’s heads-up-display reported minimal hull damage and a coolant leak near engine two. 

“Elaina, get us out of here. I’m returning to the cockpit,” Marcus said as he unclipped his restraints and climbed off of Derek, taking care not to move him too much.  

“Roger. How’s Derek?” Elaina replied.

Marcus frowned at Derek’s limp body as he clambered back towards the service passage. Without the biometrics, there was nothing he could learn without taking off his flight suit, which was dangerous, and not to mention nearly impossible in such cramped quarters.

“He’s unconscious. Nothing more we can do until back at base,” Marcus said, hoping he wasn’t a liar. 

“Copy that, commander,” Elaina replied, her voice hollow. 

“Do we have effect on target?”

“Effect on target is good. The command centre has been crippled.” 

“Switch radio to open broadcast. Tell Hatchet we’re going home,”

“Copy that.”

Elaina pulled the falcon around as Marcus wedged himself back into his seat. Elaina’s voice was like music as she gave the orders to disengage and return to base. She relinquished controls and Marcus confirmed their velocity vector, double-checking the frigate’s coordinates. He trusted the autopilot could take them the rest of the way. A few button presses switched the radio from broadcast to direct link with command.

“This is Reaper to Overlord,”

“Go ahead Reaper,”

“Poison Arrow is green, you are go for Operation Hand of God.”

“Copy that Reaper. Come on home.”
